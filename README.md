# JETS - **Squadron Simulator**
Week 3 Project for Skill Distillery Full Stack Java bootcamp... Most definitely the coolest program anyone has ever made.
## Overview
This project is a squadron simulator with lots of functionality. The program imports a list of initial jets, with factual datapoints, and pilots from text files. It then gives the user the option to edit their squadron as they please by adding and removing jets and pilots from the fleet, assigning pilots to jets, and performing various activities.

This project was a major shift into the principles of Object Oriented Programming. Every bit of the program is based around these tenants of OO, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. Abstraction was used in the Jet superclass and the two interfaces in order to simplify subclass fields and methods. Polymorphism was used in lists, by setting list object type to the superclass, I was able to build lists containing all my subclass's. Inheritance was used by designating common fields and methods in my superclass, and interfaces to simplify the code and make it more efficient. Encapsulation was kept in mind from the start, all object fields outside of main were private, and scope throughout was kept to the necessary minimum. It contain
## Technologies Used
* Development - Java
* IDE - Eclipse
* Text Editor - Atom
* Distributed Version Control - Git/ Github
* Peer Communication - Slack
## Unique Challenges
* Object Oriented Programming
* Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
* Array Lists 
* Interfaces & Objects
## Lessons Learned
* ULM was critical in planning a program of this scale. Working out the inheritance chain of interfaces/objects before hand saved a lot of headache.
* Furthering reinforcement of fundamental principles while vastly increasing utilization and working knowledge of OO.
* First project Interfaces, Lists, and the instanceof operator.
## Areas of Improvement
* Was able to meet all my stretch goals on this one.
